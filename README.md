Just install the python IDLE supported in youn PC and SQLite(DB Browser) for the database.
install the Flask,Panda library extensions (if it asks) using command prompt.
Once you run the program it will automatically create the database and the tables in it.
the connect.py is the main file to run for student side and 
admin.py is the main file for the admin side.
Once you run the code, you can use your chrome browser to view the portal
Both the Admin and Student portal will have different locallost address:
http://127.0.0.1:5001 for student side
http://127.0.0.1:5000 for admin side.
The locallost IP will appear in the IDLE Shell too if you run it, Just copy paste that in ur browser it will get you to the login page.
You can access the username/password from the database(login table).
